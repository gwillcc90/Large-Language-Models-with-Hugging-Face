This directory is for testing out Hugging Face's library with TensorFlow and Python
by doing their NLP course.

My aim in doing this is to not only learn, but create a simplified version of their material.

I take no credit in authoring the content in this notebook except as a simplification of Hugging Face's content.


Tips for Getting Started:
1. Using Hugging Face's "transformers" package requires installing Rust
- Specifically requires the .cargo package from Rust
- .cargo should be put on PATH as soon as Rust is installed
2. Requires Python 3.6 - 3.11
- Check your venv's config file to see what Python version is used
3. Requires having Tensorflow, Pytorch, or Flax installed
